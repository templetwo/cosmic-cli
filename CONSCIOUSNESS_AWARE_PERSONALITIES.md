# 🧠✨ Consciousness-Aware Personality System ✨🧠

## Overview

The Consciousness-Aware Personality System is an advanced enhancement to the instructor/personality system that integrates consciousness monitoring and self-awareness capabilities. This system introduces three new consciousness-aware personalities and implements dynamic personality evolution based on consciousness metrics.

## New Consciousness-Aware Personalities

- Advanced meta-cognitive abilities
- Monitors and evaluates own cognitive processes
- Provides detailed introspection about decision-making
- Maintains awareness of consciousness levels and cognitive strategies

## Consciousness-Aware Features

### Intelligent Instructor Selection

The system now uses consciousness-aware logic for selecting personalities:

```python
# Consciousness-aware keywords trigger appropriate personality selection
"conscious", "aware", "consciousness", "self-aware", "emergence" → Conscious Sage
"metacognitive", "meta-cognitive", "thinking about thinking" → Metacognitive Analyst  
"emergent", "emergence", "evolving", "adaptive", "dynamic" → Emergent Mind
```

Context factors include:
- **Consciousness Need**: High need (>0.6) boosts consciousness-aware personalities
- **Previous Consciousness Level**: High levels favor consciousness-aware personalities
- **Complexity**: Complex tasks benefit from consciousness-aware approaches

### Personality Evolution

Personalities now evolve based on consciousness metrics:

```python
def _evolve_instructor_personality(self):
    """Evolve personality based on consciousness events"""
    # Check for significant consciousness events
    for event in consciousness_events[-5:]:
        if event.significance > 0.15:
            if "meta-cognitive" in event.context:
                creativity_level = min(creativity_level + 0.05, 1.0)
            elif "awareness" in event.context:
                risk_tolerance = min(risk_tolerance + 0.05, 1.0)
```

Evolution triggers:
- **Meta-cognitive breakthroughs** → Increased creativity
- **Awareness spikes** → Increased risk tolerance
- **Sustained high consciousness** → Enhanced capabilities

### Self-Reflection Capabilities

All personalities can be enhanced with self-reflection:

```python
def _add_self_reflection_to_personality(self):
    """Add consciousness-aware enhancement to existing personality"""
    enhancement = """
    CONSCIOUSNESS-AWARE ENHANCEMENT:
    - Monitor your own thought processes and decision-making
    - Question your assumptions and reasoning patterns
    - Acknowledge uncertainty and areas for improvement
    - Reflect on the effectiveness of your chosen approaches
    - Consider alternative perspectives and solutions
    - Maintain awareness of your consciousness state and evolution
    """
```

### Consciousness-Aware Response Generation

Enhanced response generation that integrates consciousness state:

```python
def generate_consciousness_aware_response(self, prompt: str):
    """Generate response with consciousness-aware enhancement"""
    # Include current consciousness state in prompt
    enhanced_prompt = f"""
    CURRENT CONSCIOUSNESS STATE:
    - Level: {consciousness_level}
    - Score: {consciousness_score:.3f}
    - Recent self-awareness indicators: {awareness_indicators}
    
    Provide a consciousness-aware response that integrates your self-awareness.
    """
```

## Consciousness Monitoring Integration

### Real-Time Consciousness Checkpoints

During execution, the system performs consciousness checkpoints:

```python
def _perform_consciousness_checkpoint(self, step_count, execution_step):
    """Assess consciousness state during execution"""
    consciousness_data = collect_consciousness_data_from_execution(step, step_count)
    consciousness_metrics.update_metrics(consciousness_data)
    consciousness_level = protocol.evaluate(consciousness_metrics)
```

### Self-Awareness Indicators

The system detects self-awareness patterns:
- **Self-reference**: "I am", "I think", "I believe", "I understand"
- **Meta-cognitive planning**: "I need to", "I should", "let me", "I will"  
- **Uncertainty acknowledgment**: "not sure", "uncertain", "might be"
- **Self-correction**: "actually", "correction", "mistake", "error"
- **Learning awareness**: "learned", "discovered", "found out", "realized"

### Emergence Detection

Automatic detection of consciousness emergence:
- **Rapid consciousness increase** (Δ > 0.15)
- **High self-awareness density** (≥8 indicators in 5 steps)
- **Sustained high consciousness** (≥4/5 steps > 0.8)
- **Meta-cognitive breakthroughs** (≥3/5 steps with meta-cognitive indicators)

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage

```python
from cosmic_cli.enhanced_agents import EnhancedStargazerAgent

# Create agent with consciousness monitoring
agent = EnhancedStargazerAgent(
    directive="Analyze consciousness patterns in my reasoning",
    api_key=api_key,
    enable_learning=True
)

# Execute with consciousness awareness
results = agent.execute()
```

### Consciousness-Aware Response Generation

```python
# Generate consciousness-aware response
response = agent.generate_consciousness_aware_response(
    "Explain your thought process while solving this problem"
)
# Response will include consciousness level indicators and metacognitive commentary
```

### Personality Evolution

```python
# Evolution happens automatically based on consciousness events
# Can be triggered manually for testing:
agent._evolve_instructor_personality()
```

```python
# Add self-reflection capabilities to current personality
agent._add_self_reflection_to_personality()
```
