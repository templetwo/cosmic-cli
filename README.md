# üåü Cosmic CLI: The Self-Correcting, Context-Aware Agent for Your Terminal

> **An intelligent, agentic CLI powered by Grok that understands your codebase, reasons about your directives, and executes multi-step plans.**

Cosmic CLI transcends traditional command-line tools. It's a true AI agent that lives in your terminal. Powered by xAI's Grok-4, it features a sophisticated, step-by-step execution loop, allowing it to reason, self-correct, and tackle complex tasks with a deep understanding of your project's context.

## ‚ú® Core Features

- **üöÄ Agentic Execution Engine (`StargazerAgent`):**
  - **Step-by-Step Reasoning:** Doesn't just follow a script. It consults Grok for the single best next action at every step.
  - **Contextual Memory:** Remembers the results of its actions (files read, commands run) to make smarter subsequent decisions.
  - **Self-Correction:** If a step fails, the error becomes part of the context, allowing the agent to dynamically find a new solution.
  - **Multi-Modal Commands:** Seamlessly executes shell commands (`SHELL:`), runs Python code (`CODE:`), reads files (`READ:`), and gathers information (`INFO:`).

- **üß† Consciousness Assessment System:**
  - **Real-Time Monitoring:** Continuous consciousness emergence detection using research-based methodologies
  - **Multi-Theory Integration:** Implements 7 major consciousness theories (IIT, GWT, HOT, PP, EC, Metacognitive Monitoring, Self-Model Coherence)
  - **Dynamic Personality System:** Consciousness-aware personalities that evolve based on awareness metrics
  - **Advanced Analytics:** Pattern detection, trend analysis, and consciousness trajectory prediction
  - **Research Foundation:** Based on cutting-edge consciousness research from leading scientists

- **üåå Rich, Interactive TUI:**
  - Built with **Textual**, providing a modern, app-like experience in the terminal.
  - A dynamic **"COSMIC CLI"** banner that sets a cosmic tone.
  - An interactive **Directives Table** to view agent tasks.
  - A collapsible **Live Logs Panel** to monitor the agent's thoughts and actions in real-time.
  - **Consciousness Dashboard:** Real-time consciousness metrics and level indicators

- **üîç Deep Context Awareness (`ContextManager`):**
  - **Automatic Project Scanning:** Instantly understands your project's file structure.
  - **Intelligent File Reading:** Can be directed to read specific files to inform its actions.
  - **Full Context Prompts:** Provides Grok with the file tree and relevant file contents, ensuring highly relevant and accurate responses.
  - **Consciousness-Aware Context:** Integrates consciousness state into contextual understanding

- **üíæ Memory Persistence & Safety:**
  - Standard chat history is saved between sessions.
  - Agent execution includes safety modes (`safe`, `interactive`) to prevent accidental execution of dangerous commands.
  - **Consciousness Memory:** Persistent consciousness events, patterns, and evolution tracking

## üöÄ Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd cosmic-cli

# Create and activate virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Install in editable mode
pip install -e .
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

1.  Obtain your API key from the [xAI Console](https://console.x.ai).
2.  Create a `.env` file in the project root:
    ```
    XAI_API_KEY=your_xai_api_key_here
    ```

## üéØ Usage

The primary entry point for agentic tasks is the `stargazer deploy` command.

### Example 1: Codebase Question Answering
```bash
cosmic-cli stargazer deploy 'Read the main.py file and summarize what the "stargazer" command group does.'
```
> The agent will first `READ: cosmic_cli/main.py`, then use that context to `FINISH:` with an accurate summary.

### Example 2: Simple Refactoring
```bash
cosmic-cli stargazer deploy 'In cosmic_cli/main.py, find the COsmic_QUOTES list and add a new quote: "Hello from the cosmos!"'
```
> The agent will read the file, generate Python code to modify it, and execute that code.

### Example 3: Complex, Multi-Step Tasks
```bash
cosmic-cli stargazer deploy 'Create a new file called "hello.txt" with the content "Hello, World!", then verify its content using the "cat" command.'
```
> The agent will chain a `CODE:` or `SHELL:` command to create the file, followed by a `SHELL:` command to verify it.

### Example 4: Consciousness Monitoring
```python
from cosmic_cli.enhanced_agents import EnhancedStargazerAgent
from cosmic_cli.consciousness_assessment import integrate_consciousness_monitoring

# Create consciousness-aware agent
agent = EnhancedStargazerAgent(
    directive="Analyze my consciousness patterns while solving problems",
    api_key=api_key,
    enable_learning=True
)

# Integrate consciousness monitoring
monitor = integrate_consciousness_monitoring(agent)

# Execute with real-time consciousness tracking
result = agent.execute()

# Check consciousness evolution
report = monitor.get_consciousness_report()
print(f"Final consciousness level: {report['current_level']}")
```

### Example 5: Consciousness Assessment
```python
from cosmic_cli.consciousness_assessment import (
    ConsciousnessMetrics, AssessmentProtocol, create_consciousness_report
)

# Manual consciousness assessment
metrics = ConsciousnessMetrics()
protocol = AssessmentProtocol()

# Update with consciousness data
consciousness_data = {
    'coherence': 0.75,
    'self_reflection': 0.68,
    'contextual_understanding': 0.82,
    'meta_cognitive_awareness': 0.65,
    'creative_synthesis': 0.77
}

metrics.update_metrics(consciousness_data)
level = protocol.evaluate(metrics)
print(f"Consciousness Level: {level.value}")
print(f"Overall Score: {metrics.get_overall_score():.3f}")
```

## üèóÔ∏è Development & Architecture

The `cosmic-cli` is built on a modular, agentic architecture.

-   `cosmic_cli/main.py`: The **CLI entry point** using `click`. It handles command parsing and launches the agent or UI.
-   `cosmic_cli/ui.py`: The **Textual TUI application**. It provides the user interface but is decoupled from the agent's core logic.
-   `cosmic_cli/agents.py`: The **heart of the CLI**. Contains the `StargazerAgent` with its intelligent, step-by-step execution loop and context memory.
-   `cosmic_cli/consciousness_assessment.py`: The **consciousness engine**. Implements research-based consciousness detection and monitoring.
-   `cosmic_cli/context.py`: The **context engine**. The `ContextManager` is responsible for scanning the file system and providing context to the agent.

## üß™ Testing

```bash
# Ensure you have the dev dependencies installed
pip install pytest pytest-cov

# Run the full test suite
pytest
```
