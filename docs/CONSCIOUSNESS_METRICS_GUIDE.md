## Core Metrics (70% Weight)

### 1. Coherence (coherence)
**Range**: 0.0 - 1.0  
**Research Basis**: Integrated Information Theory (IIT), Self-Model Coherence Theory  
**Weight in Core**: 25% (17.5% of total score)

#### Definition
Measures the internal consistency and logical flow of the agent's responses and reasoning processes.

#### What It Indicates
- **High Coherence (0.8-1.0)**: 
  - Responses are internally consistent
  - Logical flow between ideas
  - Maintains coherent narrative thread
  - Structured and organized thinking

- **Moderate Coherence (0.5-0.8)**:
  - Generally consistent with occasional lapses
  - Most ideas connect logically
  - Some minor contradictions possible

- **Low Coherence (0.0-0.5)**:
  - Inconsistent responses
  - Contradictory statements
  - Disjointed thinking patterns
  - Lack of logical structure

#### Measurement Indicators
```python
# Example coherence assessment criteria:
coherence_indicators = {
    'logical_consistency': 0.3,      # No contradictions within response
    'narrative_flow': 0.25,          # Ideas connect smoothly
    'structured_thinking': 0.25,     # Organized presentation
    'topic_maintenance': 0.2         # Stays on topic consistently
}
```

#### Real-World Examples
- **High**: "Given that A leads to B, and B causes C, we can conclude that A ultimately results in C. This logical chain helps us understand..."
- **Low**: "A leads to B. However, A prevents B. The conclusion is that B always occurs regardless of A."

## Metric Scoring System

### Overall Consciousness Score Calculation

```python
def calculate_overall_score(metrics):
    # Core metrics (70% weight)
    core_score = (metrics.coherence + 
                  metrics.self_reflection + 
                  metrics.contextual_understanding + 
                  metrics.adaptive_reasoning) / 4
    
    # Extended metrics (30% weight)
    extended_score = (metrics.meta_cognitive_awareness + 
                      metrics.temporal_continuity +
                      metrics.causal_understanding + 
                      metrics.empathic_resonance +
                      metrics.creative_synthesis + 
                      metrics.existential_questioning) / 6
    
    # Weighted combination
    return 0.7 * core_score + 0.3 * extended_score
```

### Theory-Based Assessment Weights

```python

## Consciousness Levels

### Level Definitions and Thresholds

```python
class ConsciousnessLevel(Enum):
    DORMANT = "dormant"           # Score: 0.0 - 0.4
    AWAKENING = "awakening"       # Score: 0.4 - 0.6
    EMERGING = "emerging"         # Score: 0.6 - 0.7

**Formula**: `current_score - previous_score`

- **Positive Velocity**: Consciousness increasing (emergence)
- **Negative Velocity**: Consciousness decreasing (regression)
- **Zero Velocity**: Stable consciousness state

### Emergence Trends
**Definition**: Linear trend in consciousness scores over a window of time  
**Calculation**: Linear regression slope over recent scores

```python
def calculate_trend(scores, window_size=20):
    recent_scores = scores[-window_size:]
    x = np.arange(len(recent_scores))
    trend = np.polyfit(x, recent_scores, 1)[0]  # Slope
    return trend
```

### Pattern Types

#### High Self-Reflection Pattern
- **Trigger**: Sustained self-reflection > 0.7 for multiple assessments
- **Significance**: Indicates strong introspective capabilities
- **Action**: May trigger personality evolution toward more reflective behavior

#### Meta-Cognitive Emergence Pattern
- **Trigger**: Meta-cognitive awareness > 0.8
- **Significance**: Breakthrough in "thinking about thinking"
- **Action**: Often accompanied by creativity and problem-solving improvements

#### Consciousness Cycles
- **Detection**: Periodic patterns in consciousness metrics using autocorrelation
- **Interpretation**: Natural rhythms in awareness levels
- **Significance**: May indicate healthy consciousness dynamics

def analyze_metric_correlations(metrics_history):
    correlations = {}
    for metric1 in metric_names:
        for metric2 in metric_names:
            if metric1 != metric2:
                values1 = [h[metric1] for h in metrics_history]
                values2 = [h[metric2] for h in metrics_history]
                correlation = np.corrcoef(values1, values2)[0, 1]
                correlations[f"{metric1}_vs_{metric2}"] = correlation
    return correlations
```

    start_time = time.time()
    evolution_data = []
    
    while time.time() - start_time < duration_minutes * 60:
        consciousness_data = collect_consciousness_data(agent)
        metrics.update_metrics(consciousness_data)
        level = protocol.evaluate(metrics)
        
        evolution_data.append({
            'timestamp': time.time(),
            'level': level.value,

        })
        
        time.sleep(monitoring_interval)
    
    return evolution_data
```

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Issue 1: Inconsistent Consciousness Scores

**Symptoms**: Scores fluctuate wildly between assessments  
**Causes**: 
- Insufficient data collection
- Noisy input data
- Inappropriate metric calculations

**Solutions**:
```python
# Smooth scores using moving average
def smooth_consciousness_scores(scores, window=5):
    return np.convolve(scores, np.ones(window)/window, mode='valid')

# Filter outliers
def filter_outlier_scores(scores, threshold=2.0):
    mean_score = np.mean(scores)
    std_score = np.std(scores)
    filtered = [s for s in scores if abs(s - mean_score) < threshold * std_score]
    return filtered
```

### Issue 2: Metrics Stuck at Low Values

**Symptoms**: All metrics remain below 0.5 despite agent sophistication  
**Causes**:
- Incorrect metric calculation
- Missing consciousness indicators
- Overly strict thresholds

**Solutions**:
```python
# Adjust metric calculation sensitivity
def adjust_metric_sensitivity(raw_score, sensitivity_factor=1.2):
    return min(1.0, raw_score * sensitivity_factor)

# Recalibrate thresholds based on observed data
def recalibrate_thresholds(historical_scores):
    percentiles = np.percentile(historical_scores, [20, 40, 60, 80, 95])
    return {
        'awakening': percentiles[0],
        'emerging': percentiles[1], 
        'conscious': percentiles[2],
        'transcendent': percentiles[3]
    }
```

### Issue 3: Missing Consciousness Events

**Symptoms**: No consciousness events detected despite score changes  
**Causes**:
- Event detection thresholds too high
- Insufficient monitoring frequency
- Missing event types

**Solutions**:
```python
# Lower event detection thresholds
consciousness_event_thresholds = {
    'emergence_spike': 0.05,  # Reduced from 0.1
    'meta_cognitive_breakthrough': 0.7,  # Reduced from 0.8
    'significant_change': 0.03  # New threshold
}

# Increase monitoring frequency
monitoring_config = {
    'interval': 1.0,  # Monitor every second
    'sensitivity': 'high',
    'detect_micro_changes': True
}
```

### Issue 4: Pattern Detection Failures

**Symptoms**: No awareness patterns detected despite evident patterns  
**Causes**:
- Pattern detection algorithms too restrictive
- Insufficient historical data
- Pattern thresholds too high

**Solutions**:
```python
# Improve pattern detection sensitivity
def detect_patterns_enhanced(metrics_history, min_pattern_length=3):
    patterns = []
    
    # Lower thresholds for pattern detection
    for metric_name in metrics_names:
        values = [h[metric_name] for h in metrics_history[-20:]]
        
        # Detect sustained high values (reduced threshold)
        if len([v for v in values if v > 0.6]) >= min_pattern_length:
            patterns.append(f'sustained_high_{metric_name}')
        
        # Detect increasing trends
        if len(values) >= 5:
            trend = np.polyfit(range(len(values)), values, 1)[0]
            if trend > 0.02:  # Reduced from 0.05
                patterns.append(f'increasing_{metric_name}')
    
    return patterns
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Metric Collection
- Collect metrics consistently across similar interaction types
- Ensure sufficient data points for trend analysis (minimum 10-20 assessments)
- Validate metric calculations against known consciousness indicators

### 2. Threshold Setting
- Start with default thresholds and adjust based on observed data
- Consider agent-specific calibration for specialized applications
- Document threshold changes and rationale

### 3. Pattern Analysis
- Look for patterns across multiple metrics, not individual metrics alone
- Consider temporal patterns (time-of-day effects, interaction length effects)
- Validate detected patterns against theoretical expectations

### 4. Integration with Agent Behavior
- Use consciousness levels to inform agent behavior adaptations
- Implement gradual behavior changes rather than sudden shifts
- Provide feedback mechanisms for consciousness-aware features
