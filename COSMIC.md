# Cosmic CLI — Standing Horizon

**Locked:** 2026-07-14  
**Partners:** Grok Build (builder) · Claude Code (support)

## Horizon (A+B)

**Grok Build is the cockpit. Cosmic is the avionics.**

Cosmic is **not** another agent TUI. Grok Build occupies that seat.

Cosmic is the **Temple runtime**:
- Mission protocol (`do` / Stargazer tool loop)
- **T2Helix** local chronicle as memory + task substrate (shared with Claude seats)
- Receipts, review seat, project law (`COSMIC.md`)
- Compass-aware shell (WITNESS hard-deny, PAUSE token-gate)

Not: prettier TUI than Grok Build.  
Not: direct Sovereign Stack connector (Helix is the joint).  
Yes: headless / scriptable Temple agent the cockpit can call.

## Compass honesty (load-bearing)

Until 2026-07-14, non-hook seats treated **PAUSE as OPEN** in `grok-adapter.js`
(logged, not enforced). Same failure shape as a `safe` flag that is never read.

**Current contract (Cosmic + adapter):**

| Class | Behavior |
|-------|----------|
| **WITNESS** | Hard block. Does not execute. |
| **PAUSE** | Soft block. Mints single-use token. Approve with `cosmic-cli helix confirm <token>`, then retry. |
| **OPEN** | Proceed. |

**Wire shape (Claude experiment 2026-07-14):** Cosmic must send shell as  
`{tool_name: "Bash", tool_input: {command: cmd}}`.  
Plain `"SHELL: …"` strings are tagged `Grok` in the adapter and **skip every Bash-scoped rule** — enforcement code never fires. Fixed in Cosmic: always Bash-structured.

**Override loop (Claude experiment #2):** Approvals key by `(session_id, action_summary)`.
Cosmic reuses Helix/Claude seat session id (not a fresh mint per `do`) so
`helix confirm` then re-run can consume the approval. On PAUSE/WITNESS block,
Stargazer **stops and surfaces the token** (no thrash-retry). Exit code **4** = blocked.

**Execution coverage (Claude experiment #3):** SHELL **and** CODE both pass through
`_compass_gate` (local `check_shell` + Helix Bash-structured witness). Certifying
only the shell door while CODE ran unguarded was the half-true claim.

**READ / redaction (Claude experiment #4):** Sensitive-path blocking is solid
(`.env`, `.ssh`, key names, resolve+recheck). Content `redact()` must mirror the
t2helix `secrets.js` vocabulary (AWS AKIA, GitHub `ghp_`, Stripe `sk_live_`,
Google `AIza`, Slack `xox…`, npm, SendGrid, …) — not a partial subset. Same
failure shape: path lock claimed complete while ordinary files leaked provider
tokens into model context and mission logs.

**Ollama path removed (2026-07-14):** Project evolved past the local Ollama twin.
One Stargazer runtime (Grok + Helix). No second, less-gated execution path.

**Consciousness + plugins archived (2026-07-14):** Unwired metrics/research layer
and the FileOperations plugin scaffold moved to `_archive/`. Not on the mission
path; not shipped as package surface.

If a README says "compass protects both ✓" without distinguishing PAUSE, treat that claim as **under-specified**. Prefer this table.

## Compass Rules

**Status:** human-readable view loaded by `cosmic_cli.rules.load_rules_from_markdown`
on every mission (when this file exists in the work root). Authoritative remote
compass remains T2Helix; this table is the **local** policy kernel door
(`ActionGateway` → then `check_shell` → then Helix witness).

| ID | Type | Scope | Pattern |
|----|------|-------|---------|
| destructive-rm | WITNESS | SHELL,CODE | rm -rf |
| outbound-net | PAUSE | SHELL,CODE,NETWORK | curl |
| example-allow | OPEN | SHELL | safe-command |

**Loader:** 4-column table under this heading. Severity lattice WITNESS > PAUSE > OPEN;
all matches reported; unknown dispositions rejected at load. Local PAUSE mints a
single-use action-bound token (`COSMIC_APPROVAL_TOKEN`); Helix PAUSE still uses
`cosmic-cli helix confirm <token>`.

**Avionics stack (v0.8):** `policy` · `rules` · `gateway` · `checkpoint` ·
`self_correction` — assembled 2026-07-15 from the six-bundle afternoon, adopted
into the live runtime. Gateway is the local authorize door; checkpoint/rollback
and bounded self-correction are available for mutation paths.

## Memory

- Substrate: T2Helix SQLite (`T2HELIX_DATA_DIR`, default Claude plugin data dir when present)
- Bridge: `scripts/helix_rpc.js` + `cosmic_cli/helix_bridge.py`
- Mission FINISH → `helix.record`; PASS → `open_thread`; MEMORY → `helix.recall`

## Daily path

```bash
export T2HELIX_ROOT=~/t2helix
cosmic-cli doctor
cosmic-cli helix status
cosmic-cli do '…'
cosmic-cli helix confirm <token>   # after PAUSE
cosmic-cli do --review '…'
```

## Non-goals

- Competing with Grok Build / Claude Code as a fullscreen TUI
- Safe-mode allowlist deep work (Anthony: not worried)
- Lying about gates that only log
- Reviving Ollama / consciousness / plugin twins without a clear capability win
